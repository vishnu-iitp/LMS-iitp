# Library Management System (LMS) 

A simple yet feature-rich **Library Management System** built using **Python** and **MariaDB**.

This project manages books, library members, book issuing/returning, and even offers useful analytics — all through a clean and responsive GUI.

I created this project to learn backend development using Python and MariaDB, including topics like user authentication, CRUD operations, and real-world data relationships.

---

##  Overview

The LMS uses **PyQt5** for the graphical interface and **MariaDB** as the database engine.  
It supports user authentication, book inventory, member management, issuing/returning books, and visual reports.

### Core Features:
-  Search and manage books
-  Add/edit members and users (with login)
-  Password hashing using `hashlib`
-  Issue/return books with due dates
-  Top issued books chart
-  Dark Mode UI toggle

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **MariaDB using linux / MYSQL for windows**
- **PyMySQL** — Database connection
- **PyQt5** — GUI
- **hashlib** — Password hashing
- **matplotlib** — Charting
- **datetime** — Due date calculations

---

##  Database Tables

The system auto-creates these tables if they don't exist:
- `books`
- `members`
- `users`
- `issued_books`

All with proper foreign key relationships for data consistency.

##  Sample Data

If your database starts empty, 10 classic books (e.g., *1984*, *The Hobbit*, *Fahrenheit 451*) are automatically added for testing purposes.
